# 👋 Welcome aboard

Welcome to GO-Trainee! We're excited to have you on board for this educational project. Here, you'll find some valuable recommendations to ensure smooth collaboration and efficient development practices. These guidelines will help you navigate through the project, maintain a clean commit history, and make the most out of your learning experience. Let's dive in!

## 🎓 Trainee Project

The trainee project encompasses both functional and non-functional requirements, providing a comprehensive learning experience. You can find the project repository [here](https://github.com/GO-Trainee/InnoTaxi).

## 📝 Recommendations

In order to foster collaboration, maintain a clean and understandable commit history, and streamline the development process, they prove valuable for project management and code maintenance:

1. ### 🎲 Squash and Merge
   When working in feature branches, use the "Squash and Merge" feature when merging your changes into the target branch (usually develop or main). This helps maintain a clean commit history, reduces clutter, and simplifies understanding of changes by other team members.

2. ### 🔄 Rebase Policy
   If you need to integrate the latest changes from the main branch into your feature branch, it is preferable to use rebase instead of regular merging. This helps maintain a clean commit history, reduces the likelihood of conflicts, and contributes to a clearer history of changes in your repository.

3. ### 🐳 Using GHCR
   GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) provides a convenient place to store and manage Docker images directly within your repository. When developing software that depends on containerization, using GHCR can significantly simplify the process of deployment and managing containers.

4. ### 💡 Frequent Commits and Descriptive Commit Messages
   Aim for frequent, logical commits, each making small but meaningful changes. Each commit should have a descriptive message that clearly explains what was changed and why.
   The specification is located [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

### 🍀 We wish you of luck in your learning journey, and may each step lead you to new achievements and knowledge!
